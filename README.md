# Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development

about my self My name is Omar Abdel Majeed Ali I'm a software engineering BETC student I study at LTUC.

I find my passion in physics mostly and creating my own style of things I like creating characters, music, story, art and now I'm studying programming to make my own apps and games.

I never let anyone down well I have a pretty nice flexible mind however I study new things by myself a lot about the field of (IT) and I usually think out of the box to solve problems.

I have a pretty good knowledge about programming languages like HTML, C++ and Java and I have the motive and ability to study and know more other languages.

The (IT) field needs a good thinking evolving mind to keep track with changes and updates and luckily, I have a creative mind to do so.

welcome to my ***new Reading Notes*** page here i will be showing you new other **Readings** to inform you more about the IT field.
